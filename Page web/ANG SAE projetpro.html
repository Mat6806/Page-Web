        <h2>Further studies</h2>
        <p>I'm considering several courses depending on what I want to do and what I've discovered during my first year. I came to rt without any specific idea of what I'd like to do in my second year, but the course I'm most interested in at the moment is cyber. It's a field that's more and more in demand, and it looks very exciting. Moreover, I'm planning to do my second and third years on a work-study basis, which for me is a very good compromise between theory and practice, and I think that after a goal to have professional experience like work-study is essential. I'm not thinking of engineering schools, for the simple reason that I don't think I've got the level and I'm losing out on the practical side, which I don't want to neglect.</p>

        <h2>Target job</h2>
        <p>I confess that I don't yet have a precise job, it's a choice that's still too early for me, I think I've still got plenty to learn during the course. However, I recently did an interview with myjob glasses as part of my professional and personal project with a national police investigator specializing in cyber, and I have to say that after this interview I discovered an exciting job that could potentially appeal to me. I've also drawn up a list of jobs that might appeal to me: pentester, security project manager, network administrator, network architect.</p>
