            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Mathis Robin, I'm 18 and I'm graduating from the Lycée Louis Armand in 2023 with NSI and LLCE in English.  I currently live in the town of Cernay and am in my first year of BUT réseau et télécommunication at the IUT in Colmar.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>The first video game I played was Age of Empire 2, a real-time strategy video game, which left an indelible impression on me as a child, and which I still play from time to time. But it was with the arrival of my first console (Xbox 360) that I found myself playing games like Call of Duty Black Ops and GTA 5, and it was the birth of a passion.As the years went by, I bought a real PC and discovered multiplayer with games like minecraft, CS:GO or, more recently, escape from tarkov, a very realistic tactical fps that I fell in love with. It was these games that made me grow up and taught me stress management and English, and the multiplayer aspect allowed me to meet new people and make real friends.My favorite game is Minecraft, a game that has infinite possibilities, it's also the game I've played the most hours, and it's the only game I go back to all the time, so many things to do, things I've learned thanks to minecraft.</p>

           <h2>Hobbies</h2> 
            <p>In terms of sporting activities, I admit I'm not the most athletic, but walking and hiking are two activities I'm particularly fond of, as they're like an outlet for me when I need to think about something else, and the fact of simply going out walking around my home helps me a lot.But when winter arrives, there's also skiing, which I've been doing since the age of 2, a passion that runs in the family as my mother is a ski instructor from Austria. So I regularly spend my winter vacations skiing in Austria. Furthermore, I'm a member of the Cernay ski club, an association that organizes skiing and other events in Cernay.</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>If I've chosen to talk about music here, it's not because I play an instrument (although I used to play the drums when I was younger) but because I'm an avid listener. It was at the age of 13 that I discovered a style of music much listened to by young people - rap. But at that age my ears weren't yet mature enough to really understand this musical style, so I listened simply because it was the music that was fashionable among young people. But after listening closely to and discovering a whole host of artists (each one stronger lyrically and technically than the last), I've really come to realize what rap is all about, and I'm not afraid to say that rap has made me grow up and changed my way of seeing things. I've even started a vinyl collection of albums that have made an impression on me. As for my favorite artists, I'd have to say that Westside Gunn is my favorite American rapper, along with Kendrick Lamar and Tupac, and in French rap, Alpha wann and jeanjass & caballero.</p>
